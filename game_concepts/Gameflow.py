Game idea
Boss is in the castle but very strong you have 100 turns to destroy him
You need to gather gear first to be able to defeat him
On the field there are several chests that you have to go to
Along the way you will randomly encounter enemies (like pokemon also battle is the same as pokemon)
Some enemies are weak vs for example a shield etc
If you got your shield you will do critical damage against the foe
once you think you are ready go to the boss and try to defeat him
